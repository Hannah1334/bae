<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<div id="text2">
<b>Personality</b><br>
A young free spirit, a lot of times it seems like Becca doesn't have a care in the world. Her attitude toward life is very casual, and aside from being a wandering soul constantly needing to be in motion to be content, it is still incredibly easy to throw her into a state of overexcitement. Outgoing and generally cheerful, sometimes her easy smile and loud voice can be really overwhelming. Possessing minimal senses of vanity that don't expand much beyond making sure she doesn't smell like gym socks and her clothes actually match, a lot of things more stereotypical for women to enjoy like make-up and trips to the spa don't have any appeal to this little grease monkey with a huge affinity for cars and motorcycles. She'd rather have her hands covered in oil than submerged into a bath salt scrub.
<br><br>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
On the taller side for the average height regarding young ladies her own age, her physical figure is very fit and lithe. A thin layer of muscle underlies her pale white skin, which fits tightly over a vuloptuous feminine figure with plenty of shape to spare. A youthful rounded face, more adorable than beautiful, is the core of her physical identity. Full pink lips rest beneath a cute button nose splashed in a light layer of freckles, which sat between a pair of big amber eyes. She let her bright orange-red hair grow out but most often keeps it back in a ponytail, threaded through the back of a baseball cap. Typically Becca's attire consists of an oversized t-shirt, a pair of shorts coupled with a pair of knee-high socks, and little laced up tennis shoes.

<h1>Inventory</h1>
<div id="text3">
<b>Goggles</b><br>
As an experienced welder--and as someone whose magic often works with dangerous things like dust and shrapnel--Becca typically can't be found anywhere without a pair of expensive (man-made, nonmagic) good quality goggles at least strapped to her head like a headband if not placed over her eyes.
<br><br>
<b>Backpack</b><br>
A big ol' hiking sack complete with all the essentials; changes of clothing, toothbrush and toothpaste, hairbrush, a few different pairs of shoes, shampoo and conditioner, body wash, etc.
<br><br>
<b>Tool kit</b><br>
A Christmas gift from her old man. Rebecca possesses one of those around-the-waist toolbags that's full of (iron grade) typical tool essentials like screwdrivers, a hammer, wrenches, and a box knife.
</div>
</div>
<div id="box4">
<h1>Anomaly Racials</h1>
<div id="text4">
<b>Fire Resistance</b><br>
In addition to having a natural resistance to Pyromancy (x1.5), Becca's flesh is very flame retardant. While it is possible to burn her skin or light her on fire, it would require magical means or very extreme natural means to do so. Imagine that, a redhead that can go out in the sun and not get a sunburn, no lobster season for her.
<br><br>
<b>Increased Balance</b><br>
Becca's natural center of balance and ability to keep her balance are twice that of the average human's (x2), causing her to be a bit of a challenge to knock over especially if she is prepared to defend herself against whatever is being thrown her way. This also means she can stand on one foot for hours...don't know how that's a helpful talent but it's a talent. Apparently.
<br><br>
<b>Increased Reaction Time</b><br>
Her special snowflake brain processes information at an increased rate in comparison to other humans (x2), allowing her to react a bit quicker to the unexpected and expected alike.
<br><br>
<b>Fist o' the Mighty Geo</b><br>
Rebecca has the capacity to embrace three times the strength of the average human (x3), but can only access the increase during bursts of very intense emotion and doing so very quickly burns away her physical energy.

<h1>Rebecca's Background</h1>
Born and raised on the outer edges of Chicago, Illinois, Rebecca had a pretty typical childhood. Her family wasn't rich, but they certainly weren't poor either, managing to keep a nice spacious home and still never go hungry. Rebecca was an only child all her life, with two loving parents in a happy marriage and a decently healthy home to return to. She wasn't incredibly rebellious through her youth, but she was full of constant energy and sometimes was very hard to handle or just be around in general. She never intentionally snuck out and did bad things, in fact the worst of her crimes on her personal record would've been accidentally staying out with her friends past curfew just because the time slipped past her.<br><br>
Well behaved and incredibly book smart, Becca's parents held high hopes for their little girl thanks to her straight A's, and wanted their child to get into a prestigious Ivy League college to become an Engineer. The older she got, the harder they pushed, but in reality the girl had no interest in such things. She wanted to work hands on jobs, especially if they included fixing and renovating pieces of heavy machinery like cars, big trucks, and huge boats. She seemed to have a natural affinity for welding, which was her favorite class in High School, and actually enjoyed it greatly. Her desire was to expand on that, and she knew if she followed her parents' wishes she'd never truly be happy...but at the same time...she wanted them to be happy too and they'd never get over introducing their pretty daughter as the local mechanic.<br><br>
To her great relief, an answer to all her problems showed up one day in their mailbox, addressed for her eyes only. It was a personal invitation to an offshore University known as "Ulreich," and not only was it located on some foreign island, it was in another world altogether! A magic school, her own personal version of a Hogwarts letter, the whole thing would've been completely laughable if it wasn't for her experience with unnatural phenomena.<br><br>
All of her life, Rebecca would find herself doing or saying things she normally wouldn't, things she wanted to that were locked away by her own morals or sense of polite shyness, that bursted out of her almost completely outside of her own control. It always happened unexpectedly at the worst possible moments when tension or stress in her body was high and she was undergoing quite a bit of strong emotion. At age fifteen, this manifested into something greater. Another one of these episodes had come over the girl, but a bright orange aura that danced and licked the air like a flame completely engulfed her entire body, and in the core of her chest a big diamond looking gem glowed so brightly it was visible through her skin! The more time that passed, the more she attempted to repeat this occurrence, and pretty soon she discovered her own secret; she really could do magic!<br><br>
So once she graduated she packed her bags and headed to find the mystical source of her invitation, and damn what luck! She got a partner to travel with! Rebecca's childhood friend, James, also received one of these mystical letters. They had a strong bond of best-friendship desipte running in completely different social circles. James was a popular jock with a handsome face, all the girls were fawning over him, and the confusing feelings stirring inside of her for him meant she was no exception. Maybe something would finally spark between them, now that they even apparently shared some kind of magical affinity!

<h1>Who is Topaz?</h1>
<img style="height:50%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/LbMbnlo.jpg" align="left"/>
<b>Name:</b> Topaz<br>
<b>Age:</b> N/A, Ancient Ageless Spirit<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
<b>Sexuality:</b> Demisexual<br>
<b>Species:</b> Tree Guardian<br>
<b>Race:</b> Geo-Pyro Elemental<br>
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
As ironic as it is to describe her personality as "firey," it's pretty accurate. Topaz is a passionate spirit with a strong and stubborn will as well as copious amounts of courage and brazen bravery. Never afraid to speak her mind or stand firmly by what she believes is right, but still humble enough to admit when she's been proven wrong and apologize if she has caused unintentional offense. So full of life, Topaz truly is the perfect embodiment of her own magic.
<br><br>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
When inside a host body, her appearance simply matches that of her host. On her own, however, her ethereal spirit manifests as a flickering flame shaped into a humanoid female silhouette with long "hair" that flows about her wildly and big orange-amber eyes. "Height" as a spirit can vary, sometimes she prefers to stand as tall as the average humanoid female, other times she prefers to be small and compact, no bigger than a basketball.
<br><br>
<b>Backstory</b><br>
Many many years ago, in the ancient times of a world parallel to our own but very different, various magical trees were planted by two god-like and powerful beings. They were the epitomes, the core centers of the kinds of magic power they were planted to give in the first place, and from them the Elemental Guardians were born. Topaz herself had her own body once upon a time, her mother a Geomancy Elemental and her father a Pyromancy Elemental, causing her to fall under both categories with ease. This wasn't an uncommon occurrence, the longer the Elementals lived and grew the more they expanded and mingled among each other until an entire generation of duo-representers was born.<br><br>
While their people were still young and their tribes were still being established, a great war and a terrible tragedy wiped them all out. In order to make sure they could keep their protective vigil around their trees and continue to fight away those who would abuse its power, their creators ordered their own "right hand man" so to speak--a powerful entity known commonly as The Wisp Queen--to allow their spirits to inhabit human host bodies and fuse with the host body soul, giving them eternal life in a sense and allowing them to "reincarnate" or pass on to another host after death. This strange tradition continued for generations until a harsh split formed between Tree Guardians, humans, and magical beasts in general. Due to racism and prejudice, as well as yet another war that had been brewing outside of their homelands, the Elementals agreed to keep watch in spirit but refused to continue their tradition of taking human hosts as outlets and living mediums for their own magic potential.<br><br>
Topaz and her eternal lover, another Geomancer Elemental by the name of Onyx, did not agree with the segregation's existence whatsoever and fled their homelands to continue the old ways, finding themselves trapped instead in our modern human world. For many years they lived through host after host, always finding each other to live through falling in love again and again. This time, Topaz has chosen a free spirit similar in personality to herself, a girl named Rebecca. Her dearest husband, Onyx, has conveniently chosen a host of his own as well, one that Rebecca grew up with and considered her bestest friend in the whole world. Here we go again!

<div id="tab1">
<h1>Elementalism Tree Guardians</h1>
<b>Eternal Life</b><br>
Unless actively killed or destroyed, the Elementals can live on and on. They do not age nor can they die from natural causes, including nonmagic poisons, toxins, etc. They feel no hunger or thirst, and are technically wandering undead souls. It is possible for them to die, most certainly, but only by the hands of fellow mages.
<br><br>
<b>Host Possession</b><br>
As spirits themselves, the Elementals can inhabit the same space in living beings that their own souls inhabit, assuming those living beings have souls of course. Their influence on their host is very minimal, and while they cannot have complete control they can act like a voice of conscious, quietly whispering in the mind to encourage some things or discourage others. Until the souls actually fuse together, their influence lies entirely in the power of suggestion.<br>
If the Elemental spirit is destroyed before the host, either the host will lose all magic ability permanently or die themselves (depending on cause of death).
<br><br>
<b>Chains of a Mortal Coil</b><br>
Once a host body has been chosen, it cannot be abandoned or left (unless forcibly removed by powerful magic) until that host body dies. Every time a host passes away and a new one must be chosen, the spirit must start from the beginning and rise up through the ranks all over again. (Death of the character means that IF the replacement character slot is taken by the another host of the same Elemental Spirit, they MUST start over at Paige and work their way up.)
<br><br>
<b>Natural Weakness</b><br>
Magics specifically designed to target the soul are effective against Elementals. Because their souls are not as fragile as their host souls, in order to protect the host from a premature death they act like a sort of shield and take the brunt of the soul-based damage. This makes them vulnerable to offensive Necromancy or Spiritualism based magic. (x0.5 vulnerability)
<br><br>
<b>Visibility</b><br>
An Elemental Spirit cannot be detected by those who can see or communicate with spirits just with base racials, a spirit sensory spell of at least Mage rank is required to be able to detect their presence within their hosts at all.

<h1>Mana Manipulation; Universal Spells</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Geomancy; Paige</h1>
<i>"Often seen as the most primal or basic form of magic, Elementalists tap into one of six different elements to produce their magic. Each possesses a different mana type, and may use their spells to generate their chosen element. Geomancy is the control of earthen components, sometimes magma, gemstones, or even metals."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Rock Sheet: Basic Earthbending</b><br>
The caster exchanges mana for the creation of a thin, flat, sheet of rock that is capable of measuring up to six feet in height and four feet in width. While only being equal to tin in its durability (scales to Iron at Mage), it still possesses the capacity to take at least one attack of equal rank, even if that attack ends in its own destruction. Expending extra mana will allow her basic telepathic manipulation of this construct, but only in one general direction at a time. Should she be more than fifteen feet away from the construct at any time the spell in its entirety will deactivate. Only one of these sheets can be formed at once.
<br><br>
<b>Shield of Topaz</b><br>
This spell allows her Geomancy mana to solidify into a gem construct made out of topaz (Tin durability, scales to Iron at Mage). Despite having a surface area of four-by-four feet, to the caster it is weightless, and "clips" onto the outside of her forearm with an invisible bond. Like many rounded shields, this one concaves into an almost dome-like shape, and its edges are sharpened much like a sawblade, giving it cutting power one rank less than its durability (scales to Mage, and upon reaching the rank of Mage the cutting power will increase to be equal to that of the shield's durability).
<br><br>
<b>Ball of Gravel Surprises</b><br>
In exchange for a considerable amount of mana--the cost of which can be reduced if this spell is formed using pre-existing rock from the natural environment--a baseball sized sphere of pure rock (Tin, scales to Iron at Mage) is formed. Two rotations are required to fully activate this spell, and it will only continue to charge--or remain active at all--so long as it stays within a fifteen foot radius of the caster. Should it successfully reach the second rotation of its lifespan before being destroyed, the construct will destabilize and erupt into a force based explosion that encompasses a ten foot radius. While the force of the explosion can do little more than push back the average human a few feet (assuming they aren't braced or being held down by something) it will send sharp rock shrapnel and dust particles (still Tin, cutting power Tin, scales to Iron at Mage) in every direction within the explosion's radius. Requires a rotation of cooldown before it can be used again.
